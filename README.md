# Youtubers-Connected
A program that generates a list of all the youtubers on/connected to the British scene by tracing through their collabs.
It does this by getting the description of every video of a channel and then searching through each one for any more channel links. It then repeats this process for all the other channel links that it has just found.
I would love to try connect them visually i.e. with a spiderweb-like diagram - each channel connecting to all the other channels that it has collaborated with (I explain this a bit more thoroughly in this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/wq56rc/creating_a_mind_mapspiders_web_from_elements_of_a/), however I am not overly sure how to do this so any help would be much appreciated.
